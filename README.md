# Bearables

The Pimoroni [Bearables badges](https://shop.pimoroni.com/collections/bearables) include an I2C interface via the 5 programming pads on the reverse of the badges allowing basic control of the LED patterns, the individual LEDs, the button, and the ADC reading across the hooks when connected to a sensor, for example. This library exposes those functions.

## Installation

To install the Bearables library, open a terminal window, and type the following:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandyjmacdonald/bearables.git
cd bearables/library
sudo python3 setup.py install
```

Note that the installation requires the `smbus` library.
